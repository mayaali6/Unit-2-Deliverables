# Unit-2-Deliverables (TOC)
Genome Project working on aligning and evaluating sequencing reads

Deliverable 2A 
Analyzed seacuke data. Demonstration of how I trimmed appropriate adapter sequences, mapped genome, and called variants using angsd.

Deliverable 2B 
Analyzed lambda phage data. Demonstration of how I indexed the genome and called variants using bcftools. 

Deliverable 2C 
Analyzed ilumina sequencing reads. Demonstration of how I used shell and bash scripts to unzip files and generate quality reports on the data. 

Deliverable 2D 
Analyzed lambda phage, seacuke, and Tovah Day data. Culmnation of previous deliverables with information on the length and quality of the reads and how to call the variants.
